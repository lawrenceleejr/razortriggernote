Some guidelines can be found in instructions.pdf. You can produce
yourself the document (and thus test that your LaTeX setup is working)
by doing:
  cd doc
  pdflatex instructions
  bibtex   instructions
  pdflatex instructions
  pdflatex instructions

or
  cd doc
  latex instructions
  bibtex instructions
  latex instructions
  latex instructions
  dvipdf instructions

Or you could simply type 'cd doc; make instructions' :-)

The following other documents exist:
	doc/atlasphysics.pdf : Symbols defined in atlasphysics.sty
	doc/bibtex_guide.pdf : Short guide to BibTeX in ATLAS
	
Other additional files that could be useful:
	atlasphysics.sty: it contains some useful newcommands and definitions;
	emptynote.tex:    it contains the minimal setup to start typing your
                      document using atlasnote.cls class. Customize it at you own needs.

Enjoy and send commments, suggestion and bugs to the responsible.
